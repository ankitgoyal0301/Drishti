 Unless stated otherwise, the symbols have their usual meanings in context with
 subject.
 Assume suitably valid and state, additional data required, if any.
 Consider an application that requires two integer inputs x and y. Each of these inputs
 is expected to lie in the following ranges:
 3<x<7and5<y<9
 Partition the input domain using uni-dimensional and multidimensional
 partitioning.
 b) Derive test sets based on the partitions created above
